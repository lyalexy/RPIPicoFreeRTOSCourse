OS-9 (Chapter_9-Advenced) Log

This project is an advanced example that demonstrates structured logging on a Raspberry Pi Pico using FreeRTOS.
Multiple "agents" implemented in src (for example LogAgentA.cpp, LogAgentB.cpp, and BlinkAgent.cpp) run as FreeRTOS tasks and send log messages to a central logging component which queues, formats, and outputs them over the Pico's serial/USB interface. 

I made no midification to the code and just ran it.
